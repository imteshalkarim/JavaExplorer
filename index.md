# Java Explorer - Project Amorphous

Java Explorer is an open-source repository aimed at making computer science education accessible to everyone. As part of Project 8341, Java Explorer is the first step towards creating a series of educational resources that will be available to all. With Java Explorer, learners of all skill levels can explore Java programming concepts and take on programming.
