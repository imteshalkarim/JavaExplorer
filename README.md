<body><h1>Java Programs for Beginners and Intermediates</h1>

<p>Welcome to my GitHub repository where you can find a collection of Java programs for beginners and intermediate learners. I am a self-hosted open source teacher and I created this repository to help those who want to learn basic Java programming concepts by themselves.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>To get started with learning Java, you will need to have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine. You can download JDK from the official Oracle website.</p>

<h2>Programs Included</h2>

<p>This repository contains a collection of Java programs that cover basic and intermediate Java concepts. You can find programs for:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Variables and Data Types</li>
	<li>Control Structures (if-else, for loops, while loops)</li>
	<li>Methods and Functions</li>
	<li>Arrays</li>
	<li>Object-Oriented Programming (Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Polymorphism)</li>
	<li>Exception Handling</li>
</ul>

<p>Feel free to explore and learn from these programs. I have added comments in the code to help you understand each concept used.</p>

<h2>Contributing</h2>

<p>If you find any errors or want to add new programs, feel free to contribute to this repository. Just fork this repository, make your changes and create a pull request.</p>

<h2>Support</h2>

<p>If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to contact me via email. I would be happy to help you in your learning journey.</p>

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
